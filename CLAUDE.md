This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Repository Overview

1. Initial Analysis and Planning
First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. Design Inspiration
The folder design is a bootstrap5 template that I want to use as the design inspiration of the applications.  Please do
not make make any changes to any file in this folder or subfolders.  
3. Todo List Structure
The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
4. Plan Verification
Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
5. Task Execution
Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
6. Communication
Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
7. Simplicity Principle
Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
8. Process Documentation
Every time you perform actions related to the project, append your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you. Please include every prompt I give. 
9. Git Repository
Every time you make successful changes please push the changes to the current git repository.
10. HTML Folder
The html folder is the html home directory of the web server.  It is a traditional LAMP stack. All files that need to be deployed
must be in that folder or a sub-folder.
11. ID tags
In every html file make sure each div tag has a unique id that I can use to communicate with you through my prompts when I need to make style change.
12. Review Process
Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
